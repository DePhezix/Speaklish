      "feedbackDesc": "The candidate has a good command of English and is able to express complex ideas with clarity. However, there are a few minor errors and awkward phrases. For instance, the phrase 'hard and soft-skinned fiction' is unclear and the phrase 'right up my avenue' should be 'right up my alley'. In the second part, the phrase 'help your brother underwater and its brother to lure a man' is confusing and likely a miscommunication. The candidate should have said 'you just need a snorkel to help you breathe underwater and a mask to prevent water from coming into your eyes. In the third part, the phrase I think swimming is the most famous water sport in Ferdinand is unclear as 'Ferdinand' is not a known location or context. The candidate should specify what 'Ferdinand' refers to",
